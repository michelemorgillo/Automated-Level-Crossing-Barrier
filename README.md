# Automated-Level-Crossing-Barrier
This project implements an automated level crossing barrier system using ultrasound sensor technology, designed to enhance safety at railway crossings. The system employs a HC-SR04 ultrasound sensor to detect approaching vehicles or obstacles, controlling a SG90 servomotor that raises or lowers the barrier based on proximity. A STM32F401RE Nucleo-64 microcontroller serves as the control unit, managing sensor data and operating the barrier mechanism. The project also includes a manual override feature, activated by a push button, and a LED indicator to signal the systemâ€™s status. This design aims to provide an efficient and reliable solution for traffic control at level crossings.
